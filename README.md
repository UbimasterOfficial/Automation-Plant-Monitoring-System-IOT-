# Automation Plant Monitoring System (IOT)
This project represents a __Greenhouse Automation Plant Monitoring System__. Here, this code is written in C++, specifically using the Arduino framework. By using this code, all the sensors work correctly, and the caught data is taken to Node Red by the broker. The user is previewed by the Node red dashboard that carries the data. <br> <br>
It is updated in real-time via WiFi and can be accessed by computer or mobile. For that, the MQTT Broker and Node-red should be connected correctly. All the necessary codes are contained here, and as additional support, the things that happen in each code segment are given here as comments. <br><br>
After uploading all the codes to the dev board correctly, we need to go to the respective node-red IP address to monitor it by Node-red and make some settings. You can easily learn it on the Internet. <br><br>
Use this for free for educational purposes. If it is unclear, get my help. <br><br>
